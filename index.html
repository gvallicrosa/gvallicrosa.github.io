    <h2>Hobbies</h2>

    <p>
        I love nature and many cultural traditions. I try to go hiking as often as possible and at least once a year on
        a long route through the Pyrenees. I have been involved in many non-profit organizations as a volunteer. The
        first one was in the Esplai el
        Pas (scouts) since I was little and then continued leading other children. Regarding tradition, I joined two
        groups of Diables (RatpenatsInfernals and DiablesFolls), that prepare celebrations with fire and fireworks on
        the streets. Also joined
        the Xoriguers de la UdG human towers group when I started Bachelor at UdG. I also joined and helped during the
        first years of the Castellers de l'Alt Maresme, another human towers group near my hometown.
